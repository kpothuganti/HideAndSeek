HideAndSeek Animation Project
This Python script uses the cs1graphics library to create a fun and interactive animated story titled Hide and Seek. The animation features two penguin siblings playing a game of hide-and-seek in various scenic frames.

Features:
  Custom Animated Scene:
    Includes a sunny outdoor environment, moving clouds, trees, and other interactive elements like a pond and a bush.

  Penguin Characters:
    Two penguins with distinct appearances.
    Movement and dialogue animations for added engagement.
  
  Three-Act Story:
    Frame 1: The elder penguin introduces the game and walks off the frame.
    Frame 2: The younger penguin enters the scene and hides.
    Frame 3: The elder penguin looks for the younger penguin, culminating in a playful reunion.
  
  Dynamic Speech Text:
    Text bubbles appear above the penguins as they "speak."

  Smooth Transitions:
    Characters move on and off the screen with timed delays for a polished animation experience.
